![A problematic dialog box]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/use-the-right-words.png)

All too often the words used in software (and websites) suck. 

In most cases, I assume development teams don’t intentionally set out to confuse users (unless you count the team responsible for selling insurance on the [Ryanair website!](https://blog.kylegawley.com/dark-patterns-the-art-of-online-deception/){:target="_blank"} ) However by asking the wrong question and pairing it with a seemingly random assortment of possible responses the dialog box becomes unfathomable.

I’m not claiming to be a gifted copywriter. Far from it, I can barely string a sentence together. But the point is, it’s really easy to get things wrong.

Luckily there are a number of rules you can follow in order to write passable (if not great) user interface copy.
