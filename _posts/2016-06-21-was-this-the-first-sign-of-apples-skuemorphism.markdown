It’s well known that Apple’s skeuomorphic designs reached their peak some time around 2012 with leather bound calendars and faux green felt billiard tables. At this point there was a [mass outcry](https://www.fastcompany.com/1670760/will-apples-tacky-software-design-philosophy-cause-a-revolt){:target="_blank"} about how Apple had gone too far and that the designs were distracting cumbersome and inelegant.

What is lesser known though is how long Apple had been using skuemorphism in an inappropriate way. This morning I stumbled upon a great [review](https://www.fastcompany.com/1670760/will-apples-tacky-software-design-philosophy-cause-a-revolt){:target="_blank"} of Quicktime 4′s interaction on the Interface Hall of Shame. The link is below:
