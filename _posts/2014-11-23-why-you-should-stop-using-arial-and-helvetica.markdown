A really interesting take on typography on the web. I definitely agree that Helvetica can be a really bad for paragraphs of text at small sizes. It just doesn’t scan well.

As for switching to Verdana, Tahoma, or Trebuchet. I think I’ll pass. These fonts were designed for the low DPI screens of the 90s - just use a modern web font!
