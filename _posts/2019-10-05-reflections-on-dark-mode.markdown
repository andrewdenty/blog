2019 is apparently the year of dark mode. 

It’s reached Windows 10, Mac OS, Android, and has recently made its debut on iOS. Almost everyone seems to be switching to dark mode and extolling its benefits. These supposedly included, extended battery life, being easier on the eyes and aiding focus when working.

Apple even describes dark mode as ““a dramatic new look that helps you focus on your work”

While there’s no denying it looks beautiful in demos on product websites, I just can’t get used to it in practice. In fact, I tried dark mode for a few weeks, but for me it just doesn’t work at all. It comes down to one thing:

Reflections.

Here’s what I’m talking about. (Apologies for taking this on a Boris Johnson heavy news day). This is the same app, on the same day, in exactly the same lighting conditions on an iPad (with an anti-reflective screen coating). The photo was taken in a room with the curtains drawn on a dreary Scandinavian Autumn day. This isn’t exactly peak light.

My main issue with dark mode is that it actively makes it harder for me to work and focus as my reading is significantly slowed down by reflections and finger smudges obscuring the text on the screen. I found this to be the case even in low light situations, such as reading on the sofa in the evening where room lighting creates noticeable reflections. This simply is not an issue with light themes as reflections are considerably less noticeable.

After reading about this a little more I discovered that many of the other supposed benefits of dark mode aren’t real either... I recommend reading Adam Engst’s post ["The Dark Side of Dark Mode"](https://tidbits.com/2019/05/31/the-dark-side-of-dark-mode/){:target="_blank"} which goes into a lot more depth about why dark mode is inferior to regular old light mode in most situations.   

Anyway, for now I’m switching back to good-old “light mode”.
